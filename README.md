Currently working on generating a review of iPhone reviews as written "The Verge". I want to explore NLP text predicition methods write an review about a future iPhone. 

# TODO:
* ~~Build scraper~~
* ~~Build Data Transformation for Modelling~~
* Finalize and Build Model
* Write training script, and run training script.
* Check output of model
* If happy with model predictions, deploy Docker environment to share.

# Background

I am curious about writing NLP models and found after a conversation with a friend that we notice that review for the annual iPhone refresh don't seem different, so the question was raised could an AI write the review for the 2022 phone based on the assumption that the review and feature sets won't be wildly different. 

# TODO 
Write up and snippets of text
